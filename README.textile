h1. purrfect_json

An overly complicated extension which allows the formatting of JSON into cats, thereby making the JSON purrfect!

h2. Installation
From the purrfect_json directory:
<pre><code>
  rake build
  gem install pkg/purrfect_json*.gem
</code></pre>

h2. Usage

h3. Non-Rails
You need only to include the <code>PurrfectJson</code> module into a class.  Please note that the class must implement a <code>to_json</code> method.

<pre><code>class Catnip
  include PurrfectJson

  def to_json
    # some code here
  end
end</code></pre>

h3. Rails
In your environment.rb:
<pre><code>
  config.gem 'purrfect_json'
</code></pre>

If the gem is loaded with Rails present, it will automatically register the MIME type <code>text/cats</code> for the <em>.cats</em> format.  It will also automatically include itself into <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, so you should be able to start getting purrfect JSON from your models automatically.

h2. Credits

Kudos to Joey Schoblaska for the idea and original implementation, and David Nawara for the name.
